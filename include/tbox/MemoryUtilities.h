/*!
 * @brief Class MemoryUtilities provides utility methods to access 
 * information about the memory characteristics of an application.  
 * Currently, there are only methods, one called "printMemoryInfo()" which 
 * does a simple dump of the current memory usage on a processor, and 
 * "recordMemoryInfo()" which records the memory for post-process analysis.  
 *
 * Calls to these methods may be placed at various points in an application
 * to track memory usage characteristics.  For applications running on a 
 * single processor, the  call the print method is likely sufficient. The 
 * information can simply be printed to a log file or output stream.  For 
 * applications running on multiple processors, or which otherwise have 
 * complex memory patterns that cannot easily be deciphered from prints to 
 * a log file, the record method may be more useful.  Use of this method 
 * requires the TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) package to keep a 
 * profile of the recorded memory information so that it can be analyzed 
 * via a post-processing tool.
 *
 * Note that all member functions of this class are static so it is not
 * necessary to instantiate the class.  Simply call the functions as 
 * static functions; e.g.,MemoryUtilities::function(...).
